    "Feedback": "The student's answer correctly identifies that incorporating knowledge enhances the quality of responses and improves user experience. However, it lacks emphasis on the specific aspect of prediction accuracy and the importance of leveraging external resources or pre-existing knowledge, which are key components of the actual answer. This omission affects the completeness of the response, leading to a lower evaluation percentage."

    "Feedback": "The student's answer effectively captures the main points of prompt engineering best practices, aligning closely with the actual answer. The four points mentioned are correct and relevant. However, the student's response could be improved by providing a bit more detail, particularly in the explanation of the iterative process in prompt engineering. Overall, the answer is clear and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."

    "Binary Evaluation": false,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer correctly identifies text summarization and question answering as applications of prompt engineering, which aligns with the actual answer. However, the student also includes content generation and enhancing chatbot interactions, which, while relevant, are not explicitly mentioned in the actual answer. The actual answer focuses on information extraction as a key area, which the student did not mention. This omission and the addition of less relevant areas led to a lower accuracy percentage."

{
    "Accuracy": 75,
    "Binary Evaluation": false,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer correctly identifies the three prompting methods but lacks depth and specificity in the explanations. While it mentions that Zero-Shot Prompting is effective for straightforward queries, it does not clarify that it involves no examples at all. The description of Few-Shot Prompting is somewhat accurate but could benefit from mentioning that it provides a limited number of examples to guide the model. The explanation of Chain-of-Thought Prompting is too brief and does not emphasize the importance of breaking down complex problems into intermediate steps for reasoning. Overall, the answer is incomplete and lacks the necessary detail to fully align with the actual answer."

    "Accuracy": 85,
    "Binary Evaluation": true,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer effectively captures the essence of decomposing complex requests into simpler subtasks by highlighting the reduction of ambiguity and the resulting clarity in prompts. This aligns well with the actual answer, which emphasizes the incremental understanding of requests by the model. However, the student's response could have been more comprehensive by explicitly mentioning the generation of a more comprehensive response, which is a key aspect of the actual answer. Overall, the student's answer is accurate and relevant, just slightly less detailed."
},
{
  "Accuracy": 75,
  "Binary Evaluation": false,
  "Feedback": "The student's answer identifies several relevant elements of a prompt, such as clear instructions, specific context, and desired response format. However, it lacks mention of input data and output indicators, which are critical components outlined in the actual answer. Additionally, while the student emphasizes the balance between simplicity and complexity, this aspect is not explicitly mentioned in the actual answer. Overall, the response is partially correct but incomplete, leading to a lower evaluation percentage."
},
{
    "Accuracy": 75,
    "Binary Evaluation": false,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer includes some relevant best practices in prompt engineering, such as using clear prompts and experimenting with phrasing. However, it lacks depth and completeness compared to the actual answer. Key points like defining desired responses, balancing simplicity and complexity, and the iterative nature of prompt engineering were missing. This resulted in a lower accuracy percentage."

{
    "Accuracy": 80,
    "Binary Evaluation": false,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer provides several relevant best practices for prompt engineering, such as being specific, using examples, and iterating and refining prompts. However, it lacks some depth and key points present in the actual answer, such as the importance of balancing simplicity and complexity and clearly defining desired responses. Additionally, the student's answer does not emphasize the need to prevent misinterpretations by LLMs, which is crucial for effective prompt engineering. Overall, while the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, the response is not comprehensive enough to be considered correct."

{
    "Accuracy": 90,
    "Binary Evaluation": true,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer correctly identifies the elements of a prompt, including Instruction, Context, Input Data, and Output Indicator, which aligns with the actual answer. Additionally, the student accurately distinguishes between zero-shot and few-shot prompting, noting that zero-shot prompting provides no examples while few-shot prompting includes demonstrations. The response is clear and relevant, with only minor differences in wording compared to the actual answer. Overall, the student's understanding of the concepts is strong, justifying a high evaluation percentage."

{
    "Accuracy": 85,
    "Binary Evaluation": true,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer accurately describes the roles of temperature and top_p values in influencing the output of language models. It correctly identifies that temperature controls randomness and creativity, while top_p affects the diversity of responses. However, the student's explanation lacks some depth and illustrative analogies present in the actual answer, such as the cooking analogy for temperature. Overall, the response is correct and relevant, warranting a high evaluation percentage."
