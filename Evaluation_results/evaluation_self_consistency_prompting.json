    "Feedback": "The student's answer captures the essence of enhancing the quality of responses through knowledge incorporation, but it lacks specific mention of prediction accuracy and the model's ability to leverage external resources. The initial evaluation was slightly optimistic, but upon reevaluation, it became clear that the answer did not fully align with the actual answer's emphasis on prediction accuracy and context utilization."
},{
    "Accuracy": 90,
    "Binary Evaluation": true,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer accurately captures the key best practices of prompt engineering, including defining desired responses, being specific, balancing simplicity and complexity, and iterating for improvement. The response is clear and relevant, with only minor differences in wording compared to the actual answer. The initial evaluation remains consistent upon reevaluation."
},{
    "Accuracy": 85,
    "Binary Evaluation": true,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer accurately identifies key domains of prompt engineering, including text summarization and question answering, and adds content generation, which is relevant. While the actual answer is more concise, the student's response is complete and relevant, justifying the final evaluation percentage of 85%."
},{
    "Accuracy": 75,
    "Binary Evaluation": false,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer correctly identifies the three prompting methods but lacks depth and specific examples that illustrate their effectiveness. The definitions provided are somewhat accurate but do not fully capture the nuances of each method as described in the actual answer. The self-consistency check confirmed that the initial evaluation was appropriate, as the student's response did not meet the completeness and detail required for a higher score."
},{
    "Accuracy": 90,
    "Binary Evaluation": true,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer accurately captures the essence of decomposing complex requests into simpler subtasks, emphasizing clarity and reduced ambiguity. This aligns well with the actual answer, which focuses on incremental understanding and comprehensive responses. The initial evaluation remains consistent, as the student's response is relevant and complete."
},{
    "Accuracy": 80,
    "Binary Evaluation": false,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer includes relevant elements such as clear instructions, context, and desired response format, but it lacks specific mention of input data and output indicators, which are crucial components of a prompt. The initial evaluation was slightly optimistic, but upon reevaluation, it became clear that the answer was not fully comprehensive, leading to a final score of 80%."
},{
    "Accuracy": 80,
    "Binary Evaluation": false,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer includes some relevant best practices in prompt engineering, such as clarity, specificity, and experimentation. However, it lacks depth and completeness compared to the actual answer, which provides a more comprehensive list and elaborates on the importance of defining desired responses and balancing simplicity and complexity. The initial evaluation of 80% reflects these shortcomings, and upon self-consistency check, the evaluation remains consistent due to the absence of critical elements in the student's response."
},{
    "Accuracy": 85,
    "Binary Evaluation": true,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer covers several key best practices for prompt engineering, including specificity, iteration, and providing context. While it lacks some nuances present in the actual answer, such as the balance between simplicity and complexity, it still conveys the essential principles effectively. The initial evaluation was consistent upon reevaluation, leading to a final score of 85%, which is sufficient for a correct assessment."
},{
    "Accuracy": 90,
    "Binary Evaluation": true,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer accurately identifies the elements of a prompt and correctly distinguishes between zero-shot and few-shot prompting. The definitions provided are concise and relevant, aligning closely with the actual answer. The initial evaluation remains consistent upon self-consistency check, as the student's understanding of the concepts is clear and correct."
},{
    "Accuracy": 85,
    "Binary Evaluation": true,
    "Feedback": "The student's answer accurately captures the essence of both Temperature and top_p values, explaining their roles in influencing the randomness and diversity of a language model's output. While the student's response is slightly less detailed than the actual answer, it is still relevant and correct. The self-consistency check confirmed that the initial evaluation was appropriate, leading to a final score of 85%, which is sufficient for a True evaluation."
