By understanding prompt engineering, developers can improve these systems to give us even more accurate and helpful answers.LLM ParametersAmong the various parameters that influence the output of LLM (large language models), two play a significant role: temperature and top_p value. Let\u2019s define each of these parameters to understand their impact on the generated results.Temperature: Think of temperature like a spice level in cooking. A lower temperature value makes the language model play it safe and stick to the most likely predictions. It\u2019s like adding less spice, resulting in more consistent and predictable outputs. On the other hand, a higher temperature value adds more randomness and creativity to the mix, just like adding more spice to a dish and getting unexpected flavor combinations.Top_p Value: Imagine you have a multiple-choice question with various possible answers. The top_p value is like setting a threshold for how many options","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm curious about the role of temperature and top_p value in the output of large language models."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":4,"topic":"Prompt Engineering Techniques"}}
